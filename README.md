## Get Your Instance Running:

You can get an instance up instantly using one-click deployment with Heroku below:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/mayeaux/nodetube)

## Running On Your Local Computer

### Required Software
- [Node.js 8.0+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/download)
- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)

See instructions on installing these prerequisities for both [OS X](https://github.com/mayeaux/nodetube/wiki/Installation-Instructions---OS-X) and [Linux](https://github.com/mayeaux/nodetube/wiki/Installation-Instructions---Linux). There are also [Docker](https://github.com/mayeaux/nodetube/wiki/Docker) instructions if that's your thing.

Once Prerequisites Are Installed
---------------

Now that the prerequisites are ready to go it's a few simple commands to get your instance up and running.

```bash
# Get the latest version of NodeTube
git clone https://github.com/mayeaux/nodetube

# Enter the nodetube folder that was just created
cd nodetube

# Install backend and frontend dependencies
npm run installDeps

# Then simply start your app
npm start

#If you're developing locally, you can boot the app with nodemon with:
npm run dev
```

And that's it! Your first user registered will automatically be an admin user and you will be able to see the admin and moderation functionality. Each additional user will be a regular user and will be able to upload video, audio or images up to 500MB.

For ease of local development I recommend using [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) to automatically restart the app while working on backend code.

### Using ngrok
NodeTube comes with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) preinstalled with the setting in `.env.settings` to run for new instances automatically. This means that when you boot the app you will see a log come through with a link where you can access the app from the ngrok subdomain. Great you're live on the internet, that was simple!

## Technical Details

NodeTube is an Express application powered by NodeJS, with MongoDB as a database, with Redis for caching and `ffmpeg` for converting and compressing video content. It uses Pug as a templating engine and loads process variables through the `.env.settings` and `.env.private` files.

NodeTube uses `resumable.js` on the frontend as a library to allow stable and resumable uploads allowing for the upload process to not be broken during a system reboot.

NodeTube has the functionality to act as an authentication app for an nginx-rtmp server which allows NodeTube to facilitate livestreaming. NodeTube also has a built in livestreaming frontend with a live chat, live viewer count and which uses      [hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/)  to stream the files being created by [nginx-rtmp](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module)

## Reasons To Use NodeTube
### Reasons to use NodeTube as an Instance Host:

- You can run an instance either with a cloud provider, a VPS or dedicated server or even locally using a built-in `ngrok` integration.
- Follow a few short steps and get setup on top of cloud providers and run for pennies a day with built-in Heroku and BackBlaze integrations, even with little technical knowledge
- Own your own data: data is happier when it's not in the hands of a multi-billion dollar corporation and plus Google knows enough about us already
