                        h3 NewTube is a YouTube alternative powered by open-source software. NewTube is designed to be as efficient and effortless as possible from a user's perspective
                        br
                        h3 And since the software is open source anyone can run their own version of the site. The software has also been designed to be simple and easy to use, both to contribute to and to administer
                        br
                        h3 I'm going to be creating a video tutorial series to show the features of NewTube, and also a series on how to run the software to have your own YouTube alternative. That is coming soon
                        br
                        h3 Currently the best way to help support the project is to support it financially which will allow me to focus more of my productivity on this as opposed to other paid work I currently do. Best way is currently via &nbsp

                        h3 Also following the social media at the bottom of the page and spreading the word is also a great way to help the project, thank you for the support!
