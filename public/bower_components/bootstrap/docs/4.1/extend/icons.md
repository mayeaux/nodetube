Bootstrap doesn't include an icon library by default, but we have a handful of recommendations for you to choose from. While most icon sets include multiple file formats, we prefer SVG implementations for their improved accessibility and vector support.

## Preferred

We've tested and used these icon sets ourselves.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Iconic](https://useiconic.com/open/)
- [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/)

## More options

While we haven't tried these out, they do look promising and provide multiple formatsâ€”including SVG.
